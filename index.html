      William Shakespeare: The Life Of King Henry The Fifth

    <p class="tuppercase">Act III</p>
    <p>scene 1</p>
    <p class="tuppercase">King Henry</p>
    <pre>
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead!
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears
Then imitate the action of the tiger:
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood;
Disguise fair nature with hard favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect:
Let it pry throuch the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; Let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a gall'd rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide;
Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
To his full height! On, on, you noblest English!
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders
Have in this parts from morn till even fought,
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonour not your mothers! Now attest
    That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
    </pre>
